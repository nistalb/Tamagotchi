User Story

The user will navigate to the website and there will be an empty frame with a start button.
When the user pushes the start button an egg will appear that is the tomagotchi.  At the same time the user will be prompted to enter the date, time, and name of the tomagotchi.

Once this information is entered, the screen will not show the tomagotchi but will say that a tomagotchi has been born.  After 2 seconds the message goes away and we see the baby tomagotchi.  The baby will have stats: hunger, sleepiness, and boredom, that are all initialized at zero; status will be on a scale from 1 - 10.  Three buttons on the bottom of the game container will allow the baby to be fed, entertained, and put to bed.  The buttons will conatain a food item, method of entertainment, or the words "Go to Bed."  The food items and entertainment will be relevant to a baby.  The baby will require tending for one of the statuses every 10 seconds.  

After 2 minutes of playing the screen will change to a message announcing that the baby will become a child.  After 2 seconds the message goes away and we see the child tomagotchi.  The child will need the same buttons as the baby, feed, entertain, and put to bed.  The child will require tending for one of the statuses every 20 seconds, with food being the status that increases the most rapidly.

After 2 minutes of playing the screen will change to a message announcing that the child will become a teenager.  The teenager needs little sleep, lots of food, and dangerous entertainment.  

After 2 minutes of playing the screen will change to a message announcing that the teenager will become an adult.   The adult needs more sleep, less food, and mild entertainment. 

After 2 minutes as an adult the tomagotchi will die.  The image of the tomagotchi will be replaced with the text notifying the user of the death and then an image of hte dead tomagotchi will be shown.

The tomagotchi will also die if any of the status indicators reach 10.
